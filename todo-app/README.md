# Creating Angular Bookmark list 

## Lecture 2
* ng-app: Angular app searches for this and implements its functionality.
* ng-init: Variables are initialized
* ng-model: Binds input and text

## Lecture 3
* angular.module: takes 2 args: main module and array of dependencies.
* controller: define controller name and pass a function that tells what it does. Next in html set `ng-controller` as well.
* ng-repeat
We have defined a main controller with two arrays of objects, category and bookmarks.

Think of scope as the glue between the controller and the view.
